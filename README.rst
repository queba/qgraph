QGraph - A Simple Graph Library in C
====================================

QGraph is a minimal graph library in C. It currently implements the classic BFS,
DFS, topological sort algorithms, and Kruskal's algorithm to find the MST,
supporting graphs represented in the adjacency lists form.

Check those \*_test.c files for sample usages.
